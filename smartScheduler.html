                                <p>Stay-at-home parents have little time for themselves as they juggle household chores and parenting.
                                    After conducting user research, we identified time management
                                    and task scheduling as major pain points in the routines of stay-at-home parents. The project outcome was
                                    Smart Scheduler - an intelligent solution helping stay-at-home parents stay on top of their schedules and find time for their hobbies.</p>

                                <p>In the formative research phase, I conducted 4 semi-structured interviews, and acted as a notetaker for 1 interview.
                                    All team members participated in affinity analysis and brainstorming - I brainstormed 15 ideas.
                                    Then I worked with my teammates to distill user needs from our findings.</p>

                                <p> During the Design Iterations, I actively contributed to all design alternatives during the ideation, sketch, and wireframe phases.
                                    I finalized personas and made storyboards for one design alternative.
                                    After user feedback, the team worked together on the hi-fidelity prototype of the Smart Scheduler.</p>

                                <p>  During the evaluation phase, I acted as a notetaker and facilitator for 2 interviews. Finally, I analysed data by conducting
                                    affinity analysis. After the project, I made a clickable prototype from the mobile screens, and improved the
                                    clickable prototype for the main screens.</p>

                                </p>

                                <h3> RESEARCH </h3>

                                <p> We performed Task Analysis, Literature Review, Competitive Analysis, and Interviews to learn more about our users.
                                    Interviews and Affinity Mapping proved the most resourceful during our information gathering phase.</p>


                                <h4> INTERVIEWS </h4>

                                <p> We conducted semi-structured interviews
                                    with 11 stay-at-home parents which helped us to identify patterns and trends among stay-at-home parents and the challenges that
                                    they face.</p>

                                <h4> AFFINITY ANALYSIS</h4>
                                <p>In order to make sense of the significant amount of qualitative data that we rapidly collected through interviews, we choose to create an affinity map.
                                    Through this, we identified 6 user needs for stay-at-home parents:</p>

                                <div class = "row">
                                    <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                                        <p>The smart scheduler is a physical screen  (17” x 22”) placed in the home which takes the place of a calendar or planner.
                                            The smart scheduler is an amalgamation of traditional timekeeping methods and modern technological calendars.
                                            Unlike a traditional calendar, the smart scheduler is not bound to the home
                                            because of the mobile app; users are able to view their schedule and create events anywhere they want to. The main features of the system are:
                                        </p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Daily schedule shown on the right side of the screen</li>
                                            <li>Preview of the next week’s events</li>
                                            <li>Movable tab of digital sticky notes on which the user writes event details</li>
                                            <li>Smart pencil with which the user writes the sticky notes</li>
                                            <li>Expandable footer that shows monthly calendar, user’s goal of the month, a chart showing user’s monthly amount of self-care, and daily suggestions</li>
                                            <li>A mobile app that allows users to schedule on the go and get reminders about tasks​</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>
                                            What really sets the smart scheduler apart from physical and mobile calendars, however, is its emphasis on self-care.
                                            We found from our interviews that what stay-at-home parents need most is time to themselves for relaxation or hobbies and that
                                            they are not able to fulfill these needs due to their hectic schedules and the effort it takes to find events or activity groups.
                                            The smart scheduler allows stay at home parents to be cognizant of the amount of time they are actually spending on themselves and find ways to
                                            increase that if necessary. It also provides suggestions for local events related to parents’ interests so that they don’t have to spend their own time searching.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Kindly is a mobile application that enables people to find kid-friendly locations based on user ratings.
                                            This app lets parents save time by helping them find activities for their kids and cutting down on planning time for outings.
                                            Although other user-review apps for finding places exist, we identified that no other applications offered a child-focused
                                            reviewing system and considered this to be a significant enough task to warrant a separate application.</p>

                                            The more chores a family member does, the farther they move on the board, and get closer to winning.
                                            By having to do fewer chores, the SAHP would be able to spend more time on their own hobbies.

                                            as many points as the task is worth after completing a task. The player that reaches the finish line first wins
                                            and is able to win a prize that is determined by the stay-at-home-parent. The game can then be immediately reset

                                    would change each design. The results were unanimous — every stay-at-home parent preferred the Smart Scheduler.

                                        I learned to deal with circumstances in an effective manner without compromising the quality
                                        of designs or evaluations. For example, we designed a prototype on a digital platform to share
                                        it with our remote participants, and a paper prototype for our in-person study participants.

                                        I gained hands-on experience in UX Design principles and practices
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        I learnt a lot from my team members - we had long and insightful conversations about UX,
                                        Tech Industry, and other arbitrary topics.
