                              After conducting user research, we identified time management
                              and task scheduling as major pain points in the routines of stay-at-home parents. The project outcome was
                              Smart Scheduler - an intelligent solution helping stay-at-home parents stay on top of their schedules and find time for their hobbies.</p>

                            <p> We performed Task Analysis, Literature Review, Competitive Analysis, and Interviews to learn more about our users.
                                Interviews and Affinity Mapping proved the most resourceful during our information gathering phase.</p>


                             <h4> INTERVIEWS </h4>

                                    <p> We conducted semi-structured interviews
                                        with 11 stay-at-home parents which helped us to identify patterns and trends among stay-at-home parents and the challenges that
                                        they face.</p>

                                    <p>In order to make sense of the significant amount of qualitative data that we rapidly collected through interviews, we choose to create an affinity map.
                                        Through this, we identified 6 user needs for stay-at-home parents:</p>

                            <div class = "row">
                                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                                    <p>The smart scheduler is a physical screen  (17” x 22”) placed in the home which takes the place of a calendar or planner.
                                        The smart scheduler is an amalgamation of traditional timekeeping methods and modern technological calendars.
                                        Unlike a traditional calendar, the smart scheduler is not bound to the home
                                        because of the mobile app; users are able to view their schedule and create events anywhere they want to. The main features of the system are:
                                    </p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Daily schedule shown on the right side of the screen</li>
                                        <li>Preview of the next week’s events</li>
                                        <li>Movable tab of digital sticky notes on which the user writes event details</li>
                                        <li>Smart pencil with which the user writes the sticky notes</li>
                                        <li>Expandable footer that shows monthly calendar, user’s goal of the month, a chart showing user’s monthly amount of self-care, and daily suggestions</li>
                                        <li>A mobile app that allows users to schedule on the go and get reminders about tasks​</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>
                                        What really sets the smart scheduler apart from physical and mobile calendars, however, is its emphasis on self-care.
                                        We found from our interviews that what stay-at-home parents need most is time to themselves for relaxation or hobbies and that
                                        they are not able to fulfill these needs due to their hectic schedules and the effort it takes to find events or activity groups.
                                        The smart scheduler allows stay at home parents to be cognizant of the amount of time they are actually spending on themselves and find ways to
                                        increase that if necessary. It also provides suggestions for local events related to parents’ interests so that they don’t have to spend their own time searching.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3> DESIGN IDEA 2: KINDLY APP</h3>
                                    <p>Kindly is a mobile application that enables people to find kid-friendly locations based on user ratings.
                                        This app lets parents save time by helping them find activities for their kids and cutting down on planning time for outings.
                                        Although other user-review apps for finding places exist, we identified that no other applications offered a child-focused
                                        reviewing system and considered this to be a significant enough task to warrant a separate application.</p>

                                    <p> HomeHelper is a magnetic board game to hang on the fridge which helps SAHPs delegate chores.
                                        The more chores a family member does, the farther they move on the board, and get closer to winning.
                                        By having to do fewer chores, the SAHP would be able to spend more time on their own hobbies.

                                    <p>A player completes a household chore. Every chore is assigned a particular point value. The player moves ahead
                                        as many points as the task is worth after completing a task. The player that reaches the finish line first wins
                                        and is able to win a prize that is determined by the stay-at-home-parent. The game can then be immediately reset
                                        and played from the beginning. In order to counter short attention spans of children and maintain motivation, there
                                        are many chance (star) spaces along the way that can lead to small prizes and interesting twists and turns within the game.

                                interviews with 3 stay-at-home parents to determine which concept fulfilled the most urgent need in their lives and how they
                                would change each design. The results were unanimous — every stay-at-home parent preferred the Smart Scheduler.

                            <h2> VR  INTERACTION  WITH  AI</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted"> What will the experience of performing Improv Theatre in Virtual Reality be like?
                                How will that experience change if the VR user performs with an Artificial Intelligence Agent on the VR stage? </p>

                            <p>Improvisational theatre, often called Improv, is the form of theatre in which the performance is unplanned and unscripted.
                                Performers of the Improv Theatre often play the props game - where you use abstract objects and mime comedic actions with them
                                pretending them to be real-world objects. My project, titled 'The Robot Improv VR Circus' (RIC), is a VR installation in which the VR user (who
                                wears the headset) plays the props game with a partner on stage. While the VR user is impersonated as a robot, the partner is an AI agent impersonated
                                as a robot as well. Each performer mimes actions on a turn-by turn basis. Every performer's actions are dependent on, and are a reaction to
                                what their partner just performed during their latest turn. The research intent is to observe how the AI agent’s actions affect the VR user’s experience.

                            <h3> RESEARCH </h3>
                            <p>We seek to answer 5 questions about the Robot Improv VR Circus</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Diversity: Do the responses of the agent improve diversity of data given by user?
                                </li>
                                <li>Recognizability: How believable are the actions generated by the agent?</li>
                                <li>Believability: Do I believe that this action was done by a person vs a computer?
                                </li>
                                <li>Creativity Evaluation: Where do different actions fall within a creative space in regards to novelty, surprise, and value?</li>
                                <li>Explainability & Usability: Does the user understand what the agent is doing based on different explainability UI -
                                    with and without speech bubble, audio, audience UI, etc.?
                                </li>

                            </ol>
                            <p> Since the time I joined this project in August, I explored various ways - text, audio, video, pictures, and their combinations to convey
                                the action that the agent is miming with the prop. After brainstorming, I narrowed down to 3 design alternatives. I conducted usability tests with 6
                                participants to find which design alternative the users prefer.
                            </p>

                                        To engage participants during the VR experience, I decided to gamify the interaction. While conducting exploratory research, I talked to
                                        4 experts to identify an apt gamification strategy that would indulge the users. We finalized on the idea of the VR user hitting
                                        a VR buzzer after miming each action to maximize the number of mimed actions. Additionally, I improved the Audience user interface
                                        to make the UI understandable for outsiders watching the show on a screen.
                                    </p>

                            <p>
                                User feedback sessions aimed to confirm if I was proceeding on the right track with my designs. After some design iterations, I set out to develop the
                                VR space for HTC Vive. I'm currently using Unity and am finishing off the Build phase as I implement Animations using Inverse Kinematics.
                            </p>

                            <h3>EVALUATION</h3>
                            <p>Along with the game development, I started to plan for the usability studies as they require precise planning and preparation.
                            I wrote made survey questionnaires, created interview and data collection scripts, and conducted pilot studies to prepare for
                            the usability tests. Additionally, my team and I also planned to conduct MTurk studies for massive data collection.</p>

                            <h3> WHAT I LEARNED </h3>
                            <p> I learned the User Centered Design methodology followed in Georgia Tech's HCI labs. Apart from UX Research and Design,
                                I am also a software developer for this project. I wear multiple hats and have learned to think from each hat wearer's perspective.
                                 I was guided by an amazing mentor, who taught me a great deal about computational creativity and software.
                                More importantly, my mentor's humility, patience and kindness has inspired me to lead projects like he does.
                            </p>

                            <p>I studied 30 research articles to understand and gain insights about the latest spatial audio interfaces developed.

                            <p>Spatial Audio can be defined as a 3D audio experience created using headphones. ReSAC,
                                        Responsive Spatial Audio Cloud is a technology for intuitively describing the world in audio form to a person
                                with vision impairment.

                        <p>I obtained quick feedback from office employees by conducting Think Alouds with the Skyrim-like adventure game.
                        Realising that the Skyrim-like adventure game is too complex for testing a subset of ReSAC tools, we decided to build simple video games for initial testing.
                        I learnt that too many tools with a lot of flexibility increase the cognitive load of the player. Hence we decided to incorporate constraints and test tools in chunks.</p>
                            <h3>PROTOTYPING</h3>

                                   <p>I built a much simpler first-person 3D video
                                        game for conducting preliminary user studies. The game environment is a room of size 84x36 sq. ft which has typical
                                        workplace objects.</p>

            <h3> EVALUATION</h3>

                            <p> I conducted usability testing with 6 people with vision impairments.
                                I received positive feedback - all participants were able to use the interaction tools successfully.  </p>

                            <p>
                                I learnt a lot from my team during ideation and debugging phases. I developed an increased sense of passion for accessible design.
                                I was able to volunteer for two other projects while at Microsoft Research - which broadened my understanding of Emerging Markets.
                                I was guided by amazing mentors, who taught me a great deal about Assistive Technology, as well as debugging Unity applications.
                                I learnt to respect deadlines, even
                                if it means pulling all-nighters or staying at the office overnight.

                            <h2>DRAWING ROBOT</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">The Drawing Robot was my final project for the class "Gadgets, Sensors and Activity Recognition. It draws out different shapes and patterns that the computer feeds in it. The robot has been fabricated and programmed completely by me as a part of the course.</p>

                            <h3> BACKGROUND </h3>

                            <p>The project prompt for the class was to make a fully functional gadget, that does something 'cool'. I decided to make the Drawing Robot because I wanted to practice my fabrication as well as programming skills, while building something useful. Coming from a Design background, and gaining experience in computer science, mechanizing art has always fascinated me. I wanted to make something that can draw using any medium on any flat surface. So, I had the idea of making a robot that moves on a surface on wheels and draws.</p>

                            <h3> PROTOTYPING AND FUNCTIONING </h3>
                            <p> The robot consists of two main segments, the body and the circuit. The body consists of wheels that the robot moves on, a chassis that mounts the circuit, holders for batteries, and a holder for the ball-bearing. Additionally, it consists of a level that helps lift and drop the drawing pen. The body has been fully fabricated using my personal 3D printer, that I built as a part of the class "Advanced Fabrication Techniques". The body has been put together using machine screws and glue guns.</p>

                            <p>The hardware consists of two motors that are attached to the wheels. There is an additional mini-Servo motor attached to the level that helps lift and drop the pen. Additionally there is a ball bearing on the bottom that makes the robot's motion smooth as well as help balance the weight. There are 4 AA batteries on the bottom that power the robot. </p>

                            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BdTaXm5NbCg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

                            <br><br>

                            <p> The bot has been programmed to move on a certain path. This path is the shape of the required drawing. In between the robot body is a drawing pen that the lever picks and drops to draw at different locations.</p>

                            <p> The project was presented in class and received appreciation. In the second module, I used a Japanese Brush Pen to draw, and changed the lever level to alter pen pressure. This created a calligraphic effect to the drawing with varying width. As an extension of this project, I am teaching the robot to draw with sand. </p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Savour is a food discovery and comprehension mobile application, designed as a part of our 5th semester’s Interaction Design course’s project. The course involved us carrying out every step in the design process of a product up to making low fidelity mock-ups. The interaction process involved user research, need-finding, interviews, personas, scenarios, card sorting, information architecture, prototyping, wireframing, visual design and usability evaluation.</p>

                                    <p>As a part of our course, Interaction Design, we wanted to explore the domain of food and travel, and come up with a service that makes the food experience while traveling easier. We started by identifying the problem space, the stakeholders involved, and the needs of the stakeholders. We identified that a food exploration does not just influence the explorer, but a variety of stakeholders like local people, businesses, hotel owners, and other travelers. We made a map that categorizes these stakeholders in potential ‘Users’, ‘Affected’, and ‘Influential’ for our service. </p>

                                    <p>We further went on to draw an empathy map of the user, which involved understanding what each stakeholder thought, saw, said, did and heard about the domain, which was food in a new location here. We also identified the activities that these users carry out in a particular environment and the objects these interactions include. We further explored what pains and gains these interactions involved. </p>

                            <h3> USER RESEARCH </h3>

                            <p> We further made personas of the target users for our service. We observed travelers find food and interviewed them. After conducting 8 contextual inquiries, we synthesized our data into key findings, and break points in interactions. This initial exploration gave us a good idea of who the user is and what some of the pain points in food exploration were. For example, we learned that language is a huge barrier in finding food, people rely on other travelers’ reviews, and that people unknowingly settle for dishes similar to the dishes they have had before. Through competitive analysis we realized how digital applications in the market lack personalization, and there lies an opportunity for us to  add that as a feature in our service. We also realized that drawing parallels from food items makes people identify food items quicker and better. </p>

                                    <h4> Low-fidelity wireframes </h4>
                                    <p>Post our research synthesis, we identified gaps in food discovery in a new area - language, mobility, comfort; and opportunity in the domain - personalization, drawing parallels from food the travelers have had before, user control and language compatibility. One thing we learned from our user interviews was that travelers dislike carrying an additional device while they move around, which made us want to use a device that already exists in their environment - their mobile phone. We translated what we learned from our research synthesis to product features, such as - translation of menu cards, listing ingredients in food, personalized profile page with details about preferences and allergy, using OCR and translating menu card descriptions on photographs, and correlating food descriptions to previously consumed food. </p> <p> We used Balsamiq mock-up to quickly low fidelity prototype our ideas. We then tested these ideas with users, by asking them to think aloud while using these wireframes to do pre-defined tasks. One challenge we faced was to define user tasks, since this was an exploration service. Hence we left some space in the task descriptions for the users to explore and make decisions.

                                    <p>Styling the application involved several visual design decisions. We wanted the typography to be friendly and casual, reflecting the exploratory nature of our target audience. We also chose a color palette that resembled the colors of spice - black, red, yellow, and green. This color palette also gave us sufficient contrast and variety to work with. We tried several logo concepts that combine the idea of travel and food, that included the use of cutlery and crockery, and the use of pins or locators. After several iterations we narrows down on an icon that symbolized food equipment, and also hides a locator icon within it. For the product itself, we used the iOS 7 guidelines and the color scheme that we had established for the application. </p>

                        <p> This project taught me to take risks. It was a time and stamina intensive project and I ventured into a domain I had no expertise in. I learned from the artists, carpenters and fabric designers around me. I got comfortable working in a workshop. Seeing the chair evolve from a concept to a product and being used was a joyful experience. </p>

                            <h2>The Gender Gap</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">This information visualization project was carried out as a part of the elective course, Information Visualization. I designed graphics to visualise the sex ratio of urban and rural India over the years. I further made an Illustrator script to visualize a similar data from every state in the country.</p>

                             <ul class="list-inline">
                                <li><b>Timeline:</b> December 2015</li>
                                <li><b>Course:</b> Information Visualization</li>

                            </ul>

                            <h3> Background </h3>
                            <p> Decades of sex determination tests and female foeticide that has acquired genocide proportions are finally catching up with states in India. The decline in child sex ratio in India is evident by comparing the census figures. In 1991, the figure was 947 girls to 1000 boys. Ten years later it had fallen to 927 girls for 1000 boys. This is alarming. More than we realize. An imbalance in gender ration, can lead to severe repercussions for the society. Moreover, these figures depict a discriminatory history against females, that I felt compelled to bring to light. As a part of my elective course, Information Visualization, I chose to pick a socially relevant topic, and best use visualization to bring to light the gender divide of the country.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/gender-main.png" alt="">

                            <h3> Process </h3>
                            <p> The course taught me several information visualization techniques and which ones work well for specific kinds of data. I decided to chose a dataset with multiple dimensions, in order to learn multi-level data visualization. The data set included gender rations (number of female citizens for every 1000 male citizens) in urban and rural areas from 2005 to 2011. There was no data for the number of trans-gender citizens. </p>

                            <p> I iterated on several layouts to visualize this data. We went through several rounds of critique in the class and made improvements and increments in the iterations. Some initial iterations can be seen here: </p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/gender-iterations.jpg" alt="">

                            <p> I finally settled on a circular layout owing to the multi-level data. I wanted to depict the 'gap' which is why I used a 'part of a whole' technique, where the number of female citizens are shown as a part of the full circle of '1000' male citizens. The colors were used to show a gradient of alarm, while pointing out extremes. I also used a contrasting green for rare anomalies for data that stands out. For example, the state of Chhatisgarh has a gender ration higher than 1000. I used visual outlines of gender symbols and states for visual depiction of the concept. </p>


                            <p> I have, also further worked on creating custom illustrator scripts (only compatible with CS6) for visualizing data from any state. Contact me for access to the script. </p>

                            <p><b>Vineesh Kumar</b> (founder, business, distribution), <b>Vishesh Kumar</b> (content strategist), <b>Safinah Ali</b> (visual designer)</p>

                            <h3> PROCESS </h3>

                            <p>Spark was made with an intention of making learning fun. The idea was to include puzzles, games and brainteasers for high school children. We wished to include math and logic concepts, and teach strategy through solving these. The magazine was distributed in schools in New Delhi as a non-coursework monthly newsletter.</p>

                            <p> I was approached by the founder for Qureeus Eduventures to assist them in desiging the monthly newsletter. I worked with the team for creating content, finding/making puzzles and suggesting best ways to present these. </p>

                            <p> I worked with several iterations of layout design for the magazine. I started benchmarking with other magazines in the market (Highlight, Disney, Nat-Geo, Kids, Twinkle Star) and listed what works for them and what does not. I had the privilege of interviewing an avid high school magazine reader, and run my layouts by them. I conducted a think-aloud session with them for each iteration of the layout and made changes in the next iteration. </p>

                            <h3> WHAT I LEARNED </h3>

                            <p> I worked in a small team of 3, and learned to put on multiple hats. I helped with content as well as distribution, which were new domains for me. I learned techniques and practices of print design. I learned a great deal about learning and games through my team.</p>
 
                            <p> Two editions of Spark have been distributed in schools in New Delhi and received a positive feedback. We are in the process of creating an e-magazine and online subscription process for further editions. </p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">For the last 8 months, I have been experimenting with computational design to become a better programmer. I did several independent projects where I used different programming environments to create some form of interactive art. I made a game, a twitterbot, map visualizations, a TSNE grid of visuals, a star-gazing application and a couple of drawing software.</p>

                                    <p> Know Your Emoji is a text based infinite runner obstacle game. The player avatar has to jump obstacles to collect points. These obstacles are randomly selected emoji from an emoji library of 850 icons. To be able to jump, the player enters the name of the emoji. If the emoji is correctly identified, the text returned results in jumping, if not, the player collides with the obstacle and dies. With this game I wished to explore the different perceptions of visual emoji.</p>

                                    <p> I play-tested and refined game mechanics like speed, gravity in jumping and distances to make it smooth. It was interesting to see how some players thought of some icons as very different from what their tag actually was. One player also commented not the vast variety there is in emoji that they hadn’t noticed before. I used the <a href = 'http://phaser.io/'> Phaser js game library.</a> A future iteration could involve allowing players to make custom paths and draw picture stories, and having other players play with these paths.  <br> <a href = "https://github.com/safinahali/Emoji-text-game"> Source code</a></p>

                                    <h4> Growing album - Image dataset visualization </h4>
                                    <p> Growing album is a video of 11k album covers growing in saturation and complexity. The idea is to show a ‘growth pattern’ of sorts in album cover design. I gained access to <a href = "https://archive.org/details/audio-covers">a beautiful data set of 1 million audio record covers.</a> I first cleaned the image-set to remove all he junk images. Then I used ofxTSNE algorithm by Gene Kogan to make a grid of these covers sorting the visually similar images. I did multiple small grids with sets of images from the big image-set. This is the TSNE grid I got from all the images.</p>

                                    <p> I recognized several visual patterns in these album cover designs. There were shape patterns like circular disks. Several album covers had a group of people, most commonly the band members, sometimes the crowd. Some audio album covers had a single person with a guitar or another musical instrument. A group of images were just very intricate designs or ornate patterns. It was interesting to observe the change in lighting in different album covers. </p> 

                                    <p>  I used average pixel color variation from the median color of the image, and used this standard deviation measure to determine the more complex images vs the less complex. Another sorting I did was based on the image saturation. This was interesting because I saw a pattern in genres when I did the saturation sorting. A lot of classical music and jazz appeared in the less saturated images. A lot of Jazz also appeared in the night images. A lot of international music, like Indian or Japanese music appeared in the most saturated brackets. I then arranged these images in a <a href = "https://vimeo.com/161935423">video </a>and associated the Shepard sound note to them, to produce a progressive music effect, to show an increase. I want to, in the future run an image search on these albums, figure out their timespan and genre, and find patterns in these. This is an interesting image set that I continue to play with. <br> <a href = "https://github.com/safinahali/ImageSorting-SaturationVariance/"> Source code </a></p>

                                    <p> I took a meteorite strike dataset and wanted to visualize it on a map. The data was especially intriguing to me, since meteorite strikes are not something we actively thing about. I wanted to portray through a visualization that it actually happens, and the impact could be major. For my first visualization I used a simple visualization of strike locations on a map. I used Leaflet-js plug-in to implement this. I especially made use of Ingrid’s workshop on map visualization. I used the watercolor map tiles by <a href = "http://maps.stamen.com/">Stamen Design.</a></p>

                                    <p>The visualizations places all the meteorite strikes at their location on the map. In addition to that, one can click on each of the points to see the place of the name of the strike.  <br> <a href = "https://github.com/safinahali/meteorite-map.git"> Source code </a></p>

                                    <p> Paper planes is a Twitter bot that tells the story of paper planes migrating to the moon. The bot generates an image of randomly placed paper planes flying east. These images have a narrative attached to them as these planes fly out. The narratives are witty and short, like: “Flying looks good today”, or “We’re going to the moon. OkBye.”. The bot then posts these to Twitter after regular intervals of time. I used Node.js to implement this bot. I learnt making this bot from <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">Daniel Shiffman’s wonderful video tutorials,</a> and the <a href = "https://github.com/ttezel/twit">Twit-js </a>library by Ttezel. <br> <a href = "https://github.com/safinahali/meteorite-map.git"> Source code </a></p>

                                    <h4> Constellations - Interactive stargazing map </h4>
                                    <p> Constellations is an interactive application that lets you join stars and create constellations. My fascination with stargazing made me want to attempt an application with the Star Map. In an attempt to build something interactive, I made twinkling stars that can be joined with simple finger gestures to create constellations. When left idle the map automatically generates constellations. </p> <p> I used Processing 3.0 for making this app. I used multiple sources and sample projects to learn how they use the sky map locations (in the references). I took a lot of inspiration from <a href = "http://kudakurage.com/#!1/40/13_GREEN_DINING_2015">Kazuyuki Motoyama’s </a> work. I added the dimension of star locations and in-between distances for the auto mode. </p>

                                    <p> The main challenge in making this was using an actual Star Map. The interactive part in itself was easy for me, because a lot of people have made similar applications. <br> <a href = "https://github.com/safinahali/constellations"> Source code </a></p>

                                    <h4> Drawing software using a 3D mouse</h4>

                                    <p> Have you seen digital artists draw on their computers? They have one hand on their mouse, the other stretched between their keyboard and their pen-tablet. What if we use one tool that needs just one-handed use to perform all the different functions artists perform with their two and half hands? So, I set out to make a tool that helps a digital artist draw, while changing the various properties of the drawing live while drawing.</p>

                                    <p>I used <a href = "http://www.3dconnexion.com/products/spacemouse/spacenavigator.html">Spacenavigator 3D mouse </a>with a bunch of 3D CAD software to explore its functionality. The space navigator has been primarily used for 3D navigation in rendering tools.  I wanted to utilize the mouse to draw uniquely. I utilized all the degrees of freedom of the mouse to perform different functions during drawing to enhance 2D drawing. I used OpenFrameworks to create a drawing program that draws in 3D, rotates, changes the stroke width and changes the color, while it draws.

                            <p> In order to identify pain points that the website’s users face, we conducted 4 research methods - Task Analysis,
                                Cognitive Walkthrough, Interviews and Think Alouds, and Tree Testing.
                            </p>

                    <h4> TASK ANALYSIS</h4>
                    <p>We conducted task analysis to understand users’ goals and possible task flows while ordering on the
                                 Schlotzsky’s website. This allowed us to spot navigational issues and understand the process at a granular level.

                                 We formulated online ordering tasks and answered the following questions for each step in the process:</p>

                            <p> We conducted think aloud sessions with 13 participants representative of our target user group.
                                These sessions helped us to understand the website’s strengths
                                and weaknesses from the perspective of a consumer.

                            <p> Here, we wanted to get a baseline of accessibility for Schlotzsky’s competitors’ websites and online
                                ordering processes. We used accessibility testing tools to test Schlotzsky’s and its competitors websites.
                                Through the data obtained from accessibility scores, we got a good idea of how other online ordering websites
                                compared with Schlotzsky’s in terms of accessibility. We noted differences amongst the websites rated highly
                                and for us to incorporate them into our design alternatives.</p>

                                we conducted Tree Testing with 68 participants. Tree Testing helped us to understand

                        was appropriate.

                            <h2>MIDA - Car as an IoT</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Drivers, especially learners have a difficult time communicating with each other on the road, which hinders their driving ability and affects their mental state. New drivers are especially stressed out by negative feedback from other drivers. MIDA is an IoT based Intelligent Driving Assistant that provides learners with constructive feedback, with the benefit of decreasing stress and increasing freedom.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/mida-research.jpg" alt="">
                            <p> In order to understand challenges faces by drivers, particularly learners, we conducted an initial research. We used interviews, surveys, read literature on road rage, and reviewed statistics on road accidents. We focused on parking, external distractions safety, struggles that learners face internal distractions, speeding, and feedback for drivers. We found out a bunch of pain-points including parking troubles, difficulty in communication, confusing signage, and a lack of feedback. We decided to focus on communication breakdown between drivers, and stress inducing feedback experience by novice drivers.</p>

                            <h3> Service concepts </h3>
                            <p> Based on our research, we storyboarded some initial service concepts. These included:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Car to car feedback: </b> Creating a means of communication between cars (i.e. communicating via bluetooth through a built-in voice controlled audio system), so that drivers can inform other drivers of their driving constructively. Example, telling drivers to speed up, or notify or warn them.
                                </li>
                                <li> <b>Automated driving feedback: </b> Another service concept for our design opportunity is a built-in ‘intelligent assistant’ like SIRI that would grade and comment on a driver’s driving performance during and after a trip with positive criticism in a calm voice. New drivers would benefit from this type of service, as they would be receiving feedback from a third-party in a constructive manner that would not discourage / stress them and thus ruin their driving experience.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Creating empathy for drivers: </b>This service concept would be some sort of system that would monitor, grade and label a driver’s driving performance and make it visible to other drivers nearby what types of drivers are on the road. This system would allow drivers to be aware of the circumstances they are in as they share the road with other drivers, and adjust their driving accordingly
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3> Prototyping service concepts </h3>


                            <div class = "row">
                                     <p> We <b> Speed dated </b> these concepts with potential users by asking them to go through the service scenario, and think aloud what would work, or what wouldn't work for them. Based on the feedback we received, we creating 4 new service scenarios focusing on inter-car and automated feedback, as well as creating empathy for other drivers. We enacted some of these scenarios with potential users by using toy cars, and asked them to think aloud about their experience and decisions throughout the activity. We received a mixed feedback, where people were happy about in-car communication, but found positive driving feedback to be patronizing. This feedback helped up narrow down on one solution. </p>
                                
                            <h3> Solution </h3>
                            

                            <p>We created a built in an Intelligent Driving Assistant (MIDA), that provides learners with constructive feedback, to supplement driving teachers and parents with the benefit of decreasing stress and increasing freedom. This is a valuable business case because driving schools can use MIDA to teach new drivers, DMV can use MIDA to assess driving ability, it encourages better driving habit, and fewer accidents. Hence, we re-positioned our stakeholder model, due to the addition of the new service MIDA. </p>
